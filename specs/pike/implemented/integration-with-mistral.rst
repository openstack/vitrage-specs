========================
Integration with Mistral
========================

launchpad blueprint:
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/vitrage/+spec/integration-with-mistral

Support executing Mistral workflows from Vitrage.

Problem description
===================

Vitrage provides insights about the state of the cloud, but is not meant to be
a policy engine. In order to take corrective actions, for example, we need to
integrate an external engine like Mistral - the OpenStack workflow engine.

Proposed change
===============

It will be possible to define in Vitrage templates that under certain
conditions, a Mistral workflow should be executed. This gives the user the
power to decide, for example, that different corrective actions should be taken
based on the root cause of the problem (as identified by Vitrage).

Note that this blueprint is based on the external-actions blueprint, that
handles the more general case.

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

 - scenario:
    condition: host_down_alarm_on_host
    actions:
     - action:
        action_type: execute_mistral
        properties:
         workflow: wf1


Alternatives
------------
Discussed in the external-actions blueprint.
